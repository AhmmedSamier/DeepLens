## 2026-06-09 - Insecure CSP Nonce Generation
**Vulnerability:** CSP nonce generated using Math.random()
**Learning:** Math.random() is predictable and makes CSP ineffective against targeted XSS attacks.
**Prevention:** Always use cryptographically secure random number generators like crypto.randomBytes() for security tokens and nonces.
