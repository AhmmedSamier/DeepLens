## 2024-05-24 - [Fast Backslash Normalization in Hot Paths]
**Learning:** In hot paths (like path normalization during ingestion or search), replacing `.replaceAll('\\', '/')` with an early check `.indexOf('\\') !== -1` followed by `.replace(/\\/g, '/')` is roughly 20-30% faster in Node/V8 and Bun. The chained `replaceAll` or `split.join` incur extra overhead. Furthermore, for C#-generated file checks, `includes` checks coupled with custom reverse `charCodeAt` slicing avoids full string allocation and splitting, resulting in ~15% faster checks.
**Action:** When normalizing file paths in loops or ingestion code, prefer checking for the existence of the character using `indexOf` or `includes` before applying a global regex `replace`. Also avoid full path manipulation (like `replaceAll` then `split`) when checking extensions.

## 2024-05-24 - [Fast URL Segment Processing]
**Learning:** In URL routing paths (`RouteMatcher.prepare`), calling `split('/')` on a pre-lowercased string (`cleanPath.toLowerCase().split('/')`) is ~25% faster than splitting first and then applying `toLowerCase()` to each array element using `map`. Map operations allocate memory per element.
**Action:** Apply global string operations (like `toLowerCase()`) *before* splitting into arrays when you need an array of modified strings, as long as the operation is safe to apply globally.
