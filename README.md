# Find Everywhere

A VS Code extension that brings ReSharper's powerful "Search Everywhere" functionality to Visual Studio Code. Quickly find types, symbols, files, and text across your entire workspace with fuzzy matching and CamelHumps support.

## Features

### 🔍 **Search Everywhere**
- **Types**: Find classes, interfaces, and enums
- **Symbols**: Find functions, methods, and properties
- **Files**: Find files by name
- **Text**: Search text content across files (coming soon)

### ⚡ **Smart Matching**
- **Fuzzy Search**: Type partial matches like "usebas" to find "useCallback"
- **CamelHumps**: Type "RFC" to find "React.FC" or "RequestForComment"
- **Full Name Matching**: Search by fully qualified names
- **Debounced Search**: Fast, responsive searching without lag

### 🎯 **Advanced UI**
- **Filter Buttons**: Click buttons to filter by All, Classes, Symbols, or Files
- **Visual Indicators**: Active filters are highlighted with colored icons
- **Result Counts**: See "Classes (100)" in the title as you type  
- **Colored Icons**: Different colors for classes, methods, files, etc.
- **Smart Placeholder**: Changes based on active filter

### ⚙️ **Configurable**
- Customize exclude patterns
- Configure file extensions to index
- Adjust maximum results
- Enable/disable CamelHumps matching

## Usage

### Basic Search
1. Press `Shift` twice quickly (just like IntelliJ IDEA / ReSharper!)
2. Type your search query
3. Select the result to navigate to it

### Filter Buttons
Click the filter buttons at the top to narrow your search:
- **🔍 All** - Search everything
- **📦 Classes** - Only classes, interfaces, enums  
- **⚡ Symbols** - Only methods, functions, properties
- **📄 Files** - Only file names

Active filters are highlighted with colored icons and a filled circle (●).

### Examples

**Find a class:**
```
MyComponent
```

**Find using CamelHumps:**
```
RFC → React.FC
MRCT → MethodReferenceComparerTests
```

**Find a method:**
```
useState
```

**Find a file:**
```
config.ts
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  // Patterns to exclude from indexing
  "findEverywhere.excludePatterns": [
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/dist/**",
    "**/out/**",
    "**/.git/**",
    "**/build/**"
  ],

  // Maximum number of search results
  "findEverywhere.maxResults": 50,

  // Enable text search across files
  "findEverywhere.enableTextSearch": true,

  // Enable CamelHumps matching
  "findEverywhere.enableCamelHumps": true,

  // Respect .gitignore files (recommended)
  "findEverywhere.respectGitignore": true,

  // File extensions to index
  "findEverywhere.fileExtensions": [
    "ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx",
    "py", "java", "cs",
    "cpp", "c", "h",
    "go", "rb", "php"
  ]
}
```

### GitIgnore Support

✅ **The extension automatically respects `.gitignore` files** by default!

- VS Code's `workspace.findFiles` API automatically excludes:
  1. Files/folders in `.gitignore`
  2. Files matching `files.exclude` setting
  3. Patterns in `findEverywhere.excludePatterns`
  4. **C# auto-generated files** (files starting with `// <auto-generated />`)

- You can disable gitignore support by setting `"findEverywhere.respectGitignore": false`

### Indexing Progress

When the extension starts, you'll see:
- A notification showing indexing progress
- File count and symbol count as they're indexed
- Total duration when indexing completes
- Example: "Indexed 1,234 files, 5,678 symbols in 2.3s"

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift` `Shift` (double press) | Open Find Everywhere |

## How It Works

1. **Indexing**: On activation, the extension scans your workspace and indexes:
   - All files matching configured extensions
   - Symbols (classes, functions, methods, etc.) from each file using VS Code's symbol provider
   
2. **Real-time Updates**: File changes are monitored and the index is updated incrementally

3. **Fast Search**: Uses the `fuzzysort` library for lightning-fast fuzzy search with custom CamelHumps matching

4. **Smart Ranking**: Results are ranked based on:
   - Match quality
   - Item type (types > symbols > files)
   - Match position

## Comparison with ReSharper

This extension brings ReSharper's beloved "Search Everywhere" (Ctrl+T) feature to VS Code:

| Feature | ReSharper | Find Everywhere |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Search Types | ✅ | ✅ |
| Search Symbols | ✅ | ✅ |
| Search Files | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fuzzy Matching | ✅ | ✅ |
| CamelHumps | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scope Cycling | ✅ | ✅ |
| Text Search | ✅ | 🚧 Coming Soon |
| Recent Items | ✅ | 🚧 Planned |

## Performance

- Optimized for large workspaces (tested with 10,000+ files)
- Incremental indexing for fast updates
- Efficient in-memory search index

## Known Limitations

- Text search across files not yet implemented
- Recent items tracking not yet implemented
- Symbol extraction depends on VS Code's language support
