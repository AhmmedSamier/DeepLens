## 2026-03-20 - [WPF TextBox Watermark Accessibility]

**Learning:** In WPF interfaces, when layering a `TextBlock` over a `TextBox` to simulate a missing placeholder property, explicitly setting `AutomationProperties.Name=""` on the watermark is an anti-pattern. It improperly obscures the element from screen readers.
**Action:** Omit the `AutomationProperties.Name` property entirely on overlay watermarks to allow screen readers to fall back to the `Text` property naturally.

## 2026-03-19 - [Accessible Progress Indicators in WPF]

**Learning:** In WPF interfaces, ensure non-interactive progress indicators (like `ProgressBar`) include an `AutomationProperties.Name` attribute so their state and purpose remain accessible to screen readers.
**Action:** Add `AutomationProperties.Name` to `ProgressBar` elements in WPF XAML files to ensure they are accessible.

## 2026-03-09 - [Informational Empty States in QuickPick]

**Learning:** VS Code QuickPick lists do not support purely non-interactive, disabled standard items; clicking any item inherently closes the menu or acts as a confusing "dead click." To solve this for purely informational items or empty state headers, we use `kind: vscode.QuickPickItemKind.Separator`. This forces VS Code to render the item as an unselectable header, cleanly preventing unintentional dismissals without side effects.
**Action:** Always use `vscode.QuickPickItemKind.Separator` for empty state headers. We previously considered adding a secondary utility like "Copy to clipboard" for these informational items to give the dead click a purpose, but that approach risks destructively overwriting the user's clipboard during an accidental dismissal. Separators are the correct, native solution.
